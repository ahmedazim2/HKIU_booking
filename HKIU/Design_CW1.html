    <h2>Positioning</h2>
    <p>There is two uses of unique positioning schemes.</p>
    <p>First,in line 63 of theme.css, position:sticky has been used in the nav bar. This makes the navigation bar stick
        to the top of the webpages for easy access.</p>
    <p>Secondly, in the home page in line 24 of home.css, the apply now button has been used with position:fixed. This
        enables the user to have the apply button fixed in the bottom right for easy access.</p>
    <h2>CSS3 techniques</h2>
    <p>Round corners have been used in multiple occassions such as in apply.css, in lines 20 and 21 and in home.css in
        line 28.</p>
    <p>Box-shadow technique has been used in the navigation bar in line 24 of theme.css and in line 39 of apply.css to
        give a 3D effect</p>
    <p>Transitions have been used in line 57, 61 and 65 of apply.css to allow a smoother drop down transition.</p>
    <h2>Style grouping</h2>
    <p>External links are used for styling. Every page has a common theme.css for the heading, navigation bar and
        footer. Additionally, every page has their own individual css page for their own respective styling.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Fixed height(line 6) and overflow:auto(line 7) has been used in about.css paired with float(line 8, 20) to
        enable a mutli-column layout in the about page which is still functional.
    </h2>
    <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
    <h2>Let</h2>
    <p>Apply:0</p>
    <p>Program:0</p>
    <p> Visit: 117, 118, 119, 121
    </p>
    <p>Within an event listener function, let has been utilized. Having a block scope (which let possesses) enables us
        to limit the variables' use to the function because they will only be utilized inside the function or block.


    </p>
    <p>Program: 0</p>
    <h2>Const</h2>
    <p>Program: 0
    </p>
    <p>Apply:0</p>
    <p>Visit: 79, 80, 81, 82, 114
        Since all of the variables listed here are for selectors, they won't need to be altered, which will be useful
        because "constant" variables can't be assigned to other variables.
        .</p>
    <h2>Set</h2>
    <p>Program: 0</p>
    <p>Visit: 0</p>
    <p>Apply: 170 to 179, 243
        The chosen major is stored in this set rather than an array. The principal rationale behind this action was to
        avoid creating duplicates. Duplicates were being pushed into arrays when they were first utilized, which is why
        the "Total Numbers of Major Applied" was more than it should have been. As a result, a set that prohibits
        duplicate values was employed.

    </p>
    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p>Program: 62 to 102
        The program page's promotional content is managed by "the PromotionManager" class. The three promotional
        messages we need to display are contained in "promotions," which is found inside its constructor, along with
        "element," which chooses the HTML element to display these messages on, and "intervalId," which is a tracking
        method for the rotation interval.

    </p>
    <p> "getRandomPromo" selects messages at random, "displayRandomPromo" updates the webpage's designated element with
        a randomly selected promotion, and "startRotation" uses "setInterval" to continuously cycle through "promotions"
        at the predetermined interval of three seconds. "stopRotation" halts the rotation so that a message can be
        shown. The "displayInitialPromo" function ensures that the message is seen right away and starts the subsequent
        rotations after a 3-second pause.
